# Fermi-Dirac Distribution Plot (MATLAB Mini Project)

## Description
This MATLAB script plots the **Fermi-Dirac distribution function**, which describes the probability that an energy state is occupied by a fermion (such as an electron) at a given temperature. The function is widely used in **quantum mechanics and semiconductor physics**.

## Formula
The Fermi-Dirac distribution is given by:

```math
 f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_f) / (k_B T)} + 1} 
```

Where:
- \( E \) = Energy level
- \( E_f \) = Fermi energy
- \( k_B \) = Boltzmann constant (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K)
- \( T \) = Temperature in Kelvin

## Requirements
- **MATLAB, C Language** (Any version supporting basic plotting functions)

## Installation & Usage
